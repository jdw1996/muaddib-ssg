# Muad'Dib Static Site Generator

**This repository is under active development and is not yet in use.**

I've been using Jekyll for my personal website up until this point, but decided
to create my own.  I didn't have any specific problems with Jekyll, but I
wanted to have more control and thought it might be fun to build my own static
site generator (SSG).

The Muad'Dib SSG is intended to be simple and lightweight, and do precisely
what's necessary for my website.  All features are subject to change and I
won't be adding any features I'm not using.
