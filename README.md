I've been using Jekyll for my personal website up until this point, but decided
to create my own static site generator.  I didn't have any specific problems
with Jekyll, but I wanted to have more control and thought it might be fun to
build do.

The Muad'Dib SSG is intended to be simple and lightweight, and do precisely
what's necessary for my website.  All features are subject to change and I
won't be adding any features I'm not using.

You can see my website [here](https://jdw1996.github.io/).  It is the only site
I am aware of that uses Muad'Dib.
